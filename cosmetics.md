# Cosmetics & Rewards
The cosmetics strategy will follow the tried and true free-to-play model that League of Legends uses (and popularized).

Cosmetics will serve two purposes:
* Monetization - sell cosmetics to support the game
* Ranking rewards - let players show off their accomplishments and give them rewards to accompany their progression

# Abilities
Abilities' primary purpose are threefold that a well designed ability is clear 
1. **Scoring** - the most obvious purpose, abilities should the mechanism for winning the game
2. **Control** - controlling the flow of the game (the positioning of allies or enemies, the pacing, etc)
3. **Reaction** - being able to turn the tides of a skirmish or game by quick reactions gives opportunities for spectacular play and promotes playing matches out to their fullest. These are a form of control, but this reactive control is distinct enough from predictive or planned control.

The most basic and primary form of ability classification is by their cooldown.
* **Basic**: abilities without a cooldown. These are the filler/default actions that a player can take and likely to be default bound to mouse button(s).
* **Short CD**: abilities you can use many times throughout the fight. Likely in the range of 6~60 seconds.
  * :grey_question: start at a long-ish (~60 sec), but are reduced through Basic ability usage or other conditions.
* **Long CD**: abilities you can use only a few (1-2?) times throughout the fight. Likely in the range of 120~180 seconds.

Besides Basic, there's no need for a single homogeneous value for the cooldown of those abilities. They can be tuned individually for balancing.

Types of abilities that will be featured in the game
* **Movement Abilities**: Generally, most (all?) characters will have at least one movement ability with varying effectiveness. For example, strikers will generally have more and better movement abilities than most other characters.
* **Interrupts**: generally a Controller or Defender ability, but not limited to those
* **CC Breaks**: "trinket" in WoW arena - some way to break out of crowd control.
  * :grey_question: full breaks may be only limited to certain roles/characters, but partial options may be more generally available
* **Active Defensives**: all characters should have active forms of defensives to be able to trade with enemies' offensive cooldowns or to escape a dangerous situation (out of position, teammate CC'd, etc)

# Abilities
## Terms
* **Casting** refers the the usage of an ability.

## Ability Types
The most basic and primary form of ability classification is by their cooldown.
* **Basic**: abilities without a cooldown. These are the filler/default actions that a player can take and likely to be default bound to mouse button(s).
* **Short CD**: abilities you can use many times throughout the fight. Likely in the range of 6~60 seconds.
  * A possible enhancement to these might be that they start long-ish, but are reduced through (certain) Basic ability usage or other conditions.
* **Long CD**: abilities you can use only a few (1-2?) times throughout the fight. Likely in the range of 120~180 seconds.

Besides Basic, there's no need for a single homogeneous value for the cooldown of those abilities. They can be tuned individually for balancing.

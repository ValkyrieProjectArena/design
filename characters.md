# Characters
No duplicate characters on a team.

## Role
Roles define the style of play - the goals of the character. We don't use the Holy Trinity (Tank, DPS, Healer) system because all roles can do damage. The goal is that any combination of roles is a viable, competitive composition. We borrow inspiration from D&D 4e class design for the character roles.

The roles are designed to ensure a good spread of capabilities; they're not intended to mean that characters can ONLY do those things, but rather that its their primary function.

A core tenet of the role design is that **none of the roles should feel mandatory**.

<table>
<tr><th>Role</th><th>Description [1]</th></tr>

<tr>
<td><h3>Controller</h3></td>
<td>

> Controllers deal with large numbers of enemies at the same time. They favor offense over defense, using power that deal damage to multiple foes at once, as well as subtler powers that weaken, confuse, or delay their foes.
> - D&D 4th Edition Player's Handbook (Chapter 2, Making Characters)

Controllers focus on controlling the battlefield, through CC, forced movement, or zoning. For damage abilities, they opt for more area / multi-target abilities to play to their battlefield control as opposed to single-target.

</tr>

<td><h3>Defender</h3></td>
<td>

> Defenders have the highest defenses in the game and good close-up offense. They are the party's front-line combatants; wherever they're standing, that's where the action is. Defenders have abilities and powers that make it difficult for enemies to move past them or to ignore them in battle.
> - D&D 4th Edition Player's Handbook (Chapter 2, Making Characters)

Defenders focus on drawing attention to themselves and away from their teammates.
</td>
</tr>

<td><h3>Support</h3></td>
<td>

> \[Supports\] inspire, heal, and aid the other characters in an adventuring group. \[Supports\] have good defenses but their strength lies in powers that protect their companions and target specific foes for the party to concentrate on.
> - D&D 4th Edition Player's Handbook (Chapter 2, Making Characters)

We renamed Leader to Support due the conflict with the meta-game concept of a team leader (the person responsible for making team-level decisions or setting team-level goals/strategies).

Supports improve the efficacy of their team or their relative efficacy by diminishing the enemy's efficacy, to create baseline advantages.

</tr>

<td><h3>Striker</h3></td>
<td>

> Strikers specialize in dealing high amounts of damage to a single target at a time. They have the most concentrated offense of any character in the game. Strikers rely on superior mobility, trickery, or magic to move around tough foes and single out the enemy they want to attack.
> - D&D 4th Edition Player's Handbook (Chapter 2, Making Characters)

Strikers are the finishers - they're the ones that will force kills on opponents by taking advantage of opportunities to deal heavy amounts of concentrated damage.

## Company
"Company" is a more extensible & flexible take on "power source" from D&D 4e.

> Every class relies on a particular source of energy for the “fuel” that enables members of that class to use powers.
> - D&D 4th Edition Player's Handbook (Chapter 4, Character Classes)

Companies signify a unified group of characters that have a single flavour and use similar mechanics & behaviours that align with that flavour.

Each company will have one character per role to make sure that distribution of characters across roles is uniform.

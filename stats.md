# Stats
Each character has specific base stat values but can be increased in various ways.

## Offenses/Defenses
These are the primary stats which control the offensive and defensive capabilities of the character and serve as the core of the combat system.

| Offensive | Defensive | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Physical (P) | Armor (A) | Traditional physical type | Offensive: Punching, shooting bullets, explosions <br>Defensive: metal plating |
| Energy (E) | Resistance (R) | Electrical, plasma, (insert SciFi element)-based | Offensive: Lightning bolts, energy weapons, plasma beams <br>Defensive: force fields |
| Psionic (S) | Will (W) | Psychic powers | Offensive: Horrification, hallucination, demoralizing <br>Defensive: psychic barriers |


The offensive/defensive types set up a form of rock-paper-scissors with the types and their corresponding defenses.

|                | Physical | Energy | Psionic |
|----------------|:--------:|:------:|:-------:|
| **Armor**      | ⇑        | ⇓      | —       |
| **Resistance** | —        | ⇑      | ⇓       |
| **Will**       | ⇓        | —      | ⇑       |

More details about how these combat stats work can be found in the [Combat](./combat.md) document.


## Utility

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Movement Speed (MS) | The speed at which a character moves. <br>In general, this stat will likely be homogenous across characters and only increased through buffs / decreased through debuffs.<br>Might want/need shorter range characters to have slightly higher baseline to make them feel like they can stick to their targets. |
| Cast Speed (CS) | Affects how long it takes to cast abilities. Also generally uniform across characters and only modified via buffs or debuffs. |

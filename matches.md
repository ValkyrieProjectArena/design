# Matches
The match structure will be similar to WoW arena: two teams of 3 players each. Reasons for 3v3:
* Want a team game so that you can play with your friends and all the other benefits a team game brings
* Too many teams or too many players on a team makes it hard to tell what's happening as a spectator

Two teams I think is critical for it being an esports-friendly competitive game.

Five players per team feels like too much - that's how LoL is setup, but is somewhat balanced by the large map and neutral objectives. In the later stages of the game, 5v5 can feel hectic and hard to follow. On the other side, two players feels like too little - not enough room for interesting compositions and strategy. That leaves either 3 or 4; since we draw heavy inspiration from WoW arena and Battlerite, I think 3 is a good number.

## Predictable duration
* For players casually, predictable durations means it's easy to determine whether you have time for a match or how much time is left in the match. This hopefully leads to less leavers.
* For competitive play, predictable durations means it's easier to plan for production (casters, breaks, overall duration, etc).

Some variation is okay (eg, best-of-3 can be either 2 or 3 games long).

To get predictable durations:
* Not a deathmatch (at least not single-life like WoW Arena) - that adds a high amount of variability in duration
* Individual games have a set duration (eg, 5 minutes) to give a spread of 10~15 minute matches for best-of-3

## Game scoring
In order to accommodate a [predictable duration](#predictable-duration), there needs to be a scoring system.

An naive approach would be to use kills as a simple method of scoring. That puts a heavy emphasis on single targeting and focusing individual enemies because dealing a killing blow is the only manner of scoring points. It would make taking a Striker feel necessary which is counter to the goal that none of the roles are necessary.

An alternative approach would be to use health deficit. This has the following benefits:
* Healing and damage have the same value (give the same score) so it's easy to compare ability or a player's relative effectiveness
* Area and single target damage have the same value

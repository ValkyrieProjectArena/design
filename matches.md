# Matches
## Predictable duration
* For players casually, predictable durations means it's easy to determine whether you have time for a match or how much time is left in the match. This hopefully leads to less leavers.
* For competitive play, predictable durations means it's easier to plan for production (casters, breaks, overall duration, etc).

Some variation is okay (eg, best-of-3 can be either 2 or 3 games long).

To get predictable durations:
* Games have a set duration
* Players respawn when they die
* Winners are determined by least health deficit

## Game scoring
As mentioned in [predictable duration](#predictable-duration), winners are determined by least health deficit.

For balancing damage vs healing there are a few options:
* Can move some amount of healing to be shields (damage prevention/absorption) instead.
* Only allow a portion of damage taken to be healed (a la Battlerite)

Ideally even with all-healer teams, they do more damage than they can heal. No game should end 100% vs 100%.

## Respawning
Because scoring is based on health deficit, killing a player "locks in" the damage done - no amount of healing can reverse that score.

# Core Gameplay

## Telegraphs
This mechanic first (or at least most prominently) appeared in WildStar. A good introductory video from their developers:
* [Combat Telegraphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgFo28scfYM)
* [Aiming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjQLsE02OPg)

Most if not all abilities will use this system instead of direct targetting which grants the following gameplay benefits:
1. Everything is a "skill shot" makes offense reward skillful play. Not only do you have to decide what abilities to use, instead of the "chose one of X targets to use it on" it becomes "where do you think your target will be"?
2. As a defender, you are also rewarded for skillful play through the telegraphs. Recognizing the ability and dodging its target area will let you have more agency over when you take damage.
3. Using skills to zone players. You can use abilities to force enemies to stay in or out of an area.

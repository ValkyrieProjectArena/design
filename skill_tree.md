# Skill Tree
Skill tree's primary purpose is to give players the ability to customize their characters a bit to their play style. These skill trees will be very similar to WoW's classic talent trees in terms of scale of options (10~20 skills) and that skill points are global and not per-tree.

Skills in these trees can be passive skills, new abilities, or enhancements to abilities.

## Trees
Each character will have 3 trees that their points can be distributed between. These three trees:
1. Role - each role will have a uniform tree that enhances abilities / stats that synergize with that role.
2. Company - each character in a company shares this tree that synergizes with their theme.
3. Character - the final tree will be unique to the character.

## Skill Points
Not sure how many skill points players can allocate, but there should be an opportunity cost to making those decisions. For reference, WoW Classic has 51 talent points for 144 options (48 points per 3 trees), or ~35%.

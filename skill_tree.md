# Skill Tree
Skill tree's primary purpose is to give players the ability to customize their characters a bit to their play style.

Skills in these trees can be passive skills, new abilities, or enhancements to abilities.

## Trees
Each character will have 3 trees that their points can be distributed between. These three trees:
1. Role - each role will have a uniform tree that enhances abilities / stats that synergize with that role.
2. Company - each character in a company shares this tree that synergizes with their theme.
3. Character - the final tree will be unique to the character.

## Skill Points
Not sure how many skill points players can allocate, but there should be an opportunity cost to making those decisions.

For reference,
* WoW Classic has 51 talent points for 144 options (48 points per 3 trees), or ~35%.
* LoL has 4+2 major + 3 minor keystones (all choices of 3), for 33%

51 points is too many to pick or adjust before every match, something more similar to LoL's 9.
